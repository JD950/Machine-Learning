# Machine-Learning

Training an image classification model with Azure Machine Learning.

This project trains a simple logistic regression using the MNIST dataset and scikit-learn with Azure Machine Learning. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing a number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit a given image represents.

Thi was completed by utilising Azure Machine Learning service in a Python Jupyter notebook. 

Python 3.6.9.

Notebooks updated using Google Colab.
